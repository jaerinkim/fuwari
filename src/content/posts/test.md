My immediate objective in utilizing this platform is to synthesize and distill the knowledge I have accrued over recent years. This includes areas such as real analysis, linear algebra, mathematical statistics, and an assortment of statistical models. My intermediate goal involves leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to analyze publicly available linguistic datasets to infer data that are not directly accessible. Consequently, my reviews will encompass foundational aspects of NLP as well as traditional statistics. However, I do not intend to solely focus on theoretical constructs. I will delve into practical issues once I feel sufficient with my reviews on tools necessary to execute my plans effectively. You can contact me via jaerin.kim@outlook.com.
