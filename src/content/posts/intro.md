This site's immediate objective will be to review the knowledge I have learned during my coursework. This includes areas such as real analysis, linear algebra, mathematical statistics, and an assortment of statistical models. My intermediate goal involves leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to analyze publicly available linguistic datasets to infer data that are not directly accessible. So I don't intend to solely focus on theoretical constructs. I will delve into practical issues once I feel sufficient with my reviews enough to execute my plans effectively.
